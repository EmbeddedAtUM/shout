Shout for Android

> Twitter for people that you don't know that you know.

Compiling
---------

Shout uses MANES libraries, so you should have cloned the MANES repository and 
imported the MacLib and MacEntity into your Eclipse before executing the
following steps.

1. Import the Shout and ShoutTest projects located in project/ as existing
Eclipse projects

2. Set up a run configuration to run the unit tests by following the 
instructions at http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/eclipse-quick-start.html

3. If you want to run Shout on an emulator, have an AVD with the 2.2 platform
or newer
