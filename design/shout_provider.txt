The Shout content provider should almost always be accessed using the contract
class ShoutProviderContract, which is documented in its Javadocs. This document
describes the actual layout of the tables, and how to safely access them without
going through the contract class static member functions.

Tables: shout, user

Information about these tables is stored in the Shouts and Users inner classes
of ShoutProviderContract, repectively. Constants for TABLE_NAME, CONTENT_URI,
and column names are defined there.
