SHOUT ANALYTICS OVERVIEW AND GUIDE

In order to perform additional research on how users are using Shout
we are going to start tracking anonymous statistics on how the app is
being used using Google Analytics for Android.

As of July 2013, we are tracking the following statistics (all are
tracked based on date as well):

* Activity Views (what activities users are looking at the most, and at
what time, doesn't include any information beyond activity name)

* Detail views (what shout is being looked at in the details fragment,
  includes the shout hash)

* Shout creation (Shout hash and type recorded)
  * Any type of shout (Shout, Reshout, Comment, Recomment)
  * Is only called if a shout has to be created, reshouts will not do
    this the majority of the time

* Shout sent (Shout hash and type recorded)
  * Any type of shout
  * Called whenever a shout packet is sent from the application (not
  * including content like avatars)

* Shout recieved (Shout hash and type recorded)
  * Any type of shout
  * Called whenever a shout packet is recieved by the application

* Content packet recieved (Object hash and type recorded)
  * Any type of content packet (Merkle node, content descriptor,
    or content request)

* Content packet sent (Object hash and type recorded)
  * Any type of content packet


TESTING AND PRODUCTION

The manes-release repo's master branch is to be used for testing by
default, so analytics using the master branch will go to a testing
Google analytics database instead of the production one. We
don't want developer testing to influence data gathering, as it may
corrupt research later down the road.

When deploying a production build, switch branches to the
master-release branch, as that has the production Google Analytics key
on it.
